# rough_lsv_fx

**Hybrid Rough / Local‑Stochastic Volatility (LSV) FX Engine**

This project models multi‑currency FX dynamics with a hybrid local–stochastic‑volatility framework and an optional *rough* (fractional) volatility overlay.  
Built to showcase front‑office‑grade simulation, calibration, and risk analytics.

## Core Features
- Garman–Kohlhagen spot simulation (baseline)
- Hull–White stochastic short‑rate module
- Rough‑fractional volatility driver (fOU, H < 0.5)
- Planned: barrier pricing, adjoint‑MC Greeks, hedge P&L study
